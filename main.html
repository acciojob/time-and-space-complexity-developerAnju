	<h1>Time, Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>The Time Complexity and is efficient is the computational complexity that describes the 
		amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> and O(n) means that for each input element there may be 
		up to a fixed number of k bytes allocated, i.e. the amount of memory 
		needed to run the algorithm grows no faster than linearly at k*N</p>
