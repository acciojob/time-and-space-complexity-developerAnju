	<h1>Time, Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity that describes the time taken by program to complete the task. It is considered efficient when it has a low order of growth, meaning the execution time increases slowly as the input size grows.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of memory needed to run the algorithm grows no faster than linearly at k*N. O(n) takes space directly proportional to the input size. </p>
